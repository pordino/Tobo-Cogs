# Tobo-Cogs
Tobo's Cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

The *V3* branch keeps in line with Red V3 stable (i.e. the latest release).

### Status of this repository
It's true that I'm not as active as I once was in the Red community. New features are more-or-less on hold, however I'll still try to keep the cogs functional when I can.

## Installation
To add this repository, use this command in discord (replace [p] with your bot's prefix):

    [p]repo add Tobo-Cogs https://github.com/Tobotimus/Tobo-Cogs

To install a cog, use this command (replace [cog] with the name of the cog you wish to install):

    [p]cog install Tobo-Cogs [cog]

## Support

Support for these cogs is available in the [#support_tobo-cogs](https://discord.gg/c2YXKZF) channel of Red's Cog Support server.

## Contributing

I love new Issues and Pull Requests! If you think something needs to change about a cog, open an issue describing what you'd like to change.

If you feel that you can make changes yourself, I'd appreciate it if you opened the issue anyway, so we can discuss it, then you're welcome to open a pull request. We can also discuss it in the support channel linked above if you prefer.

You're also welcome to fork and modify the cogs, as long as the [GPL v3.0 license](LICENSE) is adhered to. However, it's nice when your enhancements and improvements get shared with the community without fragmenting it.
